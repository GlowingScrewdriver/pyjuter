# Pyjuter
Convert between Python source trees and Jupyter Notebooks with ease.

## THIS IS A WIP!!
Pyjuter is currently at a very early stage of development. Expect
bugs, instability, and a sense of confusion as to how to use
the thing.

Although effort is being spent on well-commented code and
reference documentation, material on the design and usage
are currently not very detailed.

## Usage
Pyjuter is developed primarily for use as a command-line tool.

At present, the command line is the only stable interface to
Pyjuter. However, it is within the scope of the project
to stabilise Pyjuter for use as a Python API as it matures.

See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) for more details.

## API Documentation
For detailed reference documentation of the internal API,
see the
[generated API docs](https://glowingscrewdriver.github.io/pyjuter)

## Caveats
* Support only for code cells -- no output, Markdown, etc.
