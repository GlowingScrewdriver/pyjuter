# Pyjuter
Convert between Python source trees and Jupyter Notebooks with ease.

For detailed reference documentation, see the
[generated API docs](https://glowingscrewdriver.github.io/pyjuter)

## Usage
Pyjuter is developed primarily for use as a command-line tool.

At present, the command line is the only stable interface to
Pyjuter. However, it is within the scope of the project
to stabilise Pyjuter for use as a Python API as it matures.

## Caveats
* Support only for code cells -- no output, Markdown, etc.
