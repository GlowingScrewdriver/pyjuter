## THIS IS A WIP!!
Pyjuter is currently at a very early stage of development. Expect
bugs, instability, and a sense of confusion as to how to use
the thing.

Although effort is being spent on well-commented code and
reference documentation, material on the design and usage
are currently not very detailed.

See (the beginnings of) the [design document](./docs/Design.md).

## Intended Usage
Pyjuter is developed primarily for use as a command-line tool.

At present, the command line is the only stable interface to
Pyjuter. However, it is within the scope of the project
to stabilise Pyjuter for use as a Python API as it matures.

See the [CLI docs](./docs/CLI.md) and the
[API docs](https://glowingscrewdriver.github.io/pyjuter).

## Caveats
* Support only for code cells -- no output, Markdown, etc.
